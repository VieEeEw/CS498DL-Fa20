(increasing conv shape with no dropout)
default Adam, epoch 20, batch 50:
Almost no result.

Default SGD, epoch 20, batch 50
Still no result

(Increasing then decreasing conv shape with no dropout)
Still no result. Seems gradient varnishing?

(Adding batch norm to the model)
Still no result

(Completely change the architecture similar to VGG16, with bn)
SGD
Still no improvement
